Roadmap
=======

Target
0.4.0       Drop support for Django 1.3
            Introduce timezone support for Django 1.4 and later
            Simplify template if statements with elif
            Display times according to user timezone, not server
            User options page:
            * Jump on click (#23)
            * Default sort order
            * Open links in new tab (#22)
            * JS options
0.5.0       Feed categorisation and entry tags
0.5.x       Ajax mark all read
            Customise HTML sanitiser to support:
            * Support whitelist of embedded media (eg youtube)
            * Delay image loading
            * Improve render time
            De-dupe multiple feeds with the same URL before checking
1.0.0       Stable release, make available on PyPI
1.1.0       Adaptive feed check frequency, with smarter spacing to spread load

The roadmap is subject to change; if a lot of people let me know that something
is a priority, I will try to move it up the list.
