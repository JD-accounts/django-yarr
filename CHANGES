Roadmap
=======

Target
0.4.0       Drop support for Django 1.3
            Introduce timezone support for Django 1.4 and later
            Display times according to user timezone, not server
0.5.0       Feed categorisation and entry tags
0.5.x       Ajax mark all read
            Customise HTML sanitiser to support:
            * Support whitelist of embedded media (eg youtube)
            * Delay image loading
            * Improve render time
            De-dupe multiple feeds with the same URL before checking
            Sort by newest/oldest
1.0.0       Stable release, make available on PyPI
1.1.0       Adaptive feed check frequency, with smarter spacing to spread load

The roadmap is subject to change; if a lot of people let me know that something
is a priority, I will try to move it up the list.
